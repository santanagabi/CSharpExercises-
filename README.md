## Using MVC : Entity Framework
This project uses the MVC architecture pattern and the Entity Framework for managing the persistence layer. To create or update the database, it is necessary to create a migration.

### Creating a migration
To create a new migration, run the following command in the Package Manager Console:
```csharp
add-migration NameOfMigration
```
Replace "NameOfMigration" with the name you want to give to the migration.
